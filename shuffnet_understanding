Debugging ShuffleNet
Note, dimension in PyTorch is N*C*H*W 


1, Conv 		24x3x1x1 (no bias)
2, BatchNorm 24 	
				(this is difference from original) which is Maxpooling --> because we using for Cifar
3, 1st Bottleneck group 
	+ input: - in_planes = 24, 
			 - out_planes = 176 (which is 200 - 24)
			 - stride = 2, groups = 2 
	+ Process
		- mid_planes = (out_planes/4) = 44
